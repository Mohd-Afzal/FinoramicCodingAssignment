-com.finoramic.utils package contains the utility class and functions. It contains the TreeNode class, Queue class and Utility class that contains some static functions for taking tree input in level wise order and print the tree in level wise order.


-Input format for tree :

There are 2 lines in the input

Line 1 ( Corresponds to arg 1 ) : First number represents the number of integers in input line. Then follows serialized representation of the tree. The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order description of left and right child of nodes, where -1 signifies a NULL child.
    For example,
         1
        / \ 
       2    3
          /
        4
         \
          5
    will have representation as {1 2 3 -1 -1 4 -1 -1 5 -1 -1}
    The first integer on the line indicates the number of integers to follow in the serialized representation of the tree.

Line 2 ( Corresponds to arg 2 ) : A single integer
    For example, Integer: 2 will be written as "2"(without quotes).


-"main" package contains the code for the Questions asked to implem implement.
